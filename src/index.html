                    <p>
                        I'm Joe. Nice to meet you. I am a multi-talented individual who is just beginning his coding journey. I have a history in both the business world and in academia that complement each other well for the creation of commercial web projects. I understand what businesses are typically looking for and speak their language well. Also, I have experience in very precise thinking that came with years of philosophy writing and argumentation. I find joy in coding and the problem solving that comes along with it. I am voracious when it comes to learning new tools, but also learning old tools in depth.
